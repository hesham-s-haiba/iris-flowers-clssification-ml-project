This project is a machine learning classification task based on the famous **Iris Flower Dataset**. The goal is to accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* using various machine learning models.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains 150 records with 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width  
Each record also includes the species label.

## ⚙️ Project Structure

- `iris_flowers_clssification_ml_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all the analysis, visualizations, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🚀 Features

- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Data preprocessing and label encoding
- Model training using:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation using accuracy and classification reports
- Confusion matrices for performance visualization
- Comparison of model results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Model Performance

All models were evaluated using accuracy scores and confusion matrices. The Random Forest and SVM models achieved the highest performance on this dataset.

## 📷 Visualizations

Visualizations include pair plots, histograms, and heatmaps to better understand feature distributions and relationships.

## 📂 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flowers-classification.git
   cd iris-flowers-classification
